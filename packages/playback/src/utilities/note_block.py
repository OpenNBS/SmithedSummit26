        # This is achieved by bypassing the `volume` argument completely and instead using the
        # target selector's `distance` argument to determine what players will be able to hear
        # the song at all. Decay is achieved by using the `distance` argument to limit the range
        # of the sound, with a base range and a rolloff factor that increases the audible range
        # of notes according to its pitch (lower notes will be audible from further away).
        #
        # The regular value for volume in a /playsound command is 1.0 = 16 blocks. It's possible
        # to increase it to increase the audible range (e.g. 2.0 = 32 blocks and so on), but
        # decreasing it does *not* actually decrease the audible range, as you'd expect (e.g.
        # 0.5 = 8 blocks). Instead, the sound is still audible within a 16-block range, but is
        # softer overall.

        # works with a base range of 9, adding ±3 blocks for lower and higher notes, giving an
        # effective range between 6-12 blocks. This rolloff can be easily customized by tweaking
        # the parameters of the sigmoid function used in the calculation. This creates a harsher
